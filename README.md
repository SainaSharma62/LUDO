Ludo Game
Project Description
This is a classic Ludo game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game allows up to four players to participate, each controlling their own set of tokens (goti). The game follows traditional Ludo rules, where players roll dice, move their gotis around the board, and try to capture the opponents' tokens.

Features
Four Players: Up to four players can play the game simultaneously.
Realistic Dice Roll: Players take turns rolling the dice to move their gotis.
Token Movement: Players move their tokens around the board based on the dice roll.
Kill Opponents: If a player's token lands on the same spot as an opponent's, the opponent’s goti is sent back to the starting point.
Safe Zones: Certain areas on the board are safe, where no opponent can kill a player's token.
Winning Condition: The first player to get all their gotis to the finish wins the game.

How to Play
Each player takes a turn to roll the dice.
Based on the dice roll, move one of your tokens around the board.
If you land on a square with an opponent’s token, you send their goti back to the start.
Safe zones protect your gotis from being killed by other players.
The goal is to move all four of your tokens from the start, around the board, and into the home area.

Technologies Used
HTML: Structure and layout of the game.
CSS: Styling for the board, tokens, and overall game design.
JavaScript: Game logic, including dice rolling, goti movement, and handling player turns.
